# Order System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a new order system with the following structure:

### Tables Created:
1. **orders** table - One record per user order (multiple products grouped)
2. **order_products** table - Individual product records for each order

## Files Created/Modified:

### 1. Database Migrations
- `database/migrations/2025_01_15_000001_create_new_orders_table.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_01_15_000002_create_order_products_table.php`

### 2. Models
- `app/Models/OrderProduct.php` (NEW)
- `app/Models/Order.php` (UPDATED)
- `app/Models/Payment.php` (UPDATED)

### 3. Controllers
- `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php` (UPDATED)
- `app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php` (UPDATED)

### 4. Views
- `resources/views/website/orders/my-orders.blade.php` (UPDATED)

## Database Schema:

### orders table:
- id (primary key)
- order_id (unique string - payment order ID)
- payment_id (foreign key to payments table)
- user_id (foreign key to users table)
- total_price (decimal)
- status (enum: pending, approved, completed, delivered)
- timestamps

### order_products table:
- id (primary key)
- order_id (foreign key to orders table)
- payment_id (foreign key to payments table)
- variant_id (foreign key to product_variants table)
- unit_price (decimal - discounted_price from variant)
- quantity (integer)
- status (enum: pending, approved, completed, delivered)
- timestamps

## Implementation Flow:

### When Payment is Successful:
1. Payment status is updated to 'paid'
2. PaymentItems are created (existing functionality)
3. **NEW**: Single Order record is created with total_price
4. **NEW**: OrderProduct records are created for each cart item
5. Cart is cleared

### Key Features:
- One order record per payment (multiple products grouped)
- Individual product tracking in order_products table
- Status management at both order and product level
- Proper relationships between orders, payments, and products

## Next Steps to Complete:

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Update OrderController orderDetails method
The orderDetails method in OrderController needs to be updated to use the new relationships:

```php
$order = Order::with([
    'payment', 
    'orderProducts.variant.product',
    'orderProducts.variant'
])
    ->where('user_id', Auth::id())
    ->where('id', $id)
    ->first();
```

### 3. Create/Update Order Details View
Create or update `resources/views/website/orders/order-details.blade.php` to work with the new structure.

### 4. Admin Order Management
Update admin order views to work with the new structure:
- Update `viewOrder` method in OrderController
- Update admin order listing views

### 5. CSS Updates (Optional)
Add CSS styles for new order statuses in my-orders.blade.php:
```css
.status-approved {
    background: #cce5ff;
    color: #004085;
}

.status-completed {
    background: #d1ecf1;
    color: #0c5460;
}
```

## Testing:
1. Add products to cart
2. Proceed to payment
3. Complete payment successfully
4. Check that:
   - Order record is created with correct total_price
   - OrderProduct records are created for each cart item
   - My Orders page displays correctly
   - Order details page works

## Benefits of New Structure:
- Single order per payment (cleaner organization)
- Individual product status tracking
- Better reporting capabilities
- Easier order management for admins
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Scalable for future enhancements
